+  *Snapchat is a fast, fun way to share moments with friends and family. Most of our community uses Snapchat every day, so it isn’t surprising that parents and teachers regularly ask us for advice. We share your concerns and wish to provide a safe, fun environment for creativity and expression*

+  *You can easily report inappropriate content to us right in the app! Just press and hold on the Snap, then tap the 'Report Snap' button. Let us know what’s going on — we’ll do our best to help! Learn more about reporting abuse in‑app and download our Quick-Guide to Snapchat Reporting*

+  *Since the beginning, Snapchat has been about empowering people to express themselves with their camera. We didn’t want to create a social network where you automatically friend everyone you know, or where you only see what’s most popular. Instead, we wanted to make it easier for people, publishers, and brands to tell their stories — their way!*

+  *Snapchat is for personal communication, not broadcasting*
