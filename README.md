+  *Snapchat is a fast, fun way to share moments with friends and family. Most of our community uses Snapchat every day, so it isn’t surprising that parents and teachers regularly ask us for advice. We share your concerns and wish to provide a safe, fun environment for creativity and expression*

+  *You can easily report inappropriate content to us right in the app! Just press and hold on the Snap, then tap the 'Report Snap' button. Let us know what’s going on — we’ll do our best to help! Learn more about reporting abuse in‑app and download our Quick-Guide to Snapchat Reporting*

+  *Since the beginning, Snapchat has been about empowering people to express themselves with their camera. We didn’t want to create a social network where you automatically friend everyone you know, or where you only see what’s most popular. Instead, we wanted to make it easier for people, publishers, and brands to tell their stories — their way!*

+  *Snapchat is for personal communication, not broadcasting*

Snapchat is, without a doubt, the most popular social media app among Gen Z users. While the messaging app is already feature-packed, Snapchat Plus elevates the experience with cool new upgrades. Snapchat regularly adds new features to its paid subscription, allowing you to change the app’s icon, view who rewatched your story, and mark specific friends as BFFs. To help you understand the latter, Snapchat’s Plus subscription rolled out a new feature called Snapchat Friend Solar System, which assigns a planet to close friends of yours

Every planet in the Snapchat friend solar system corresponds to a different position on your list of Best Friends, and the order of planets in the Solar System is identical to the order of planets in our existing solar system. Since you are the Sun of your Snapchat friend solar system, Mercury is assigned to the friend you share the most snaps and chats with, Venus to the second closest one, and it goes on till Neptune, who is your eighth best friend

**And to help you understand the meaning of Snapchat planets better, we have explained them in detail along with their corresponding emoji below**
